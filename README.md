# project3 - Image Classification using AWS sagemaker
This is the third project in the AWS machine learning nanodegree program. AWS sagemaker was used to fine-tune thr ResNet18 pretained model on the dog breed dataset available in 
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip
The project was completed by making good use of the tools available to a machine learning engineer. Among such tools are the Pytorch framework, a pretrained model, profiler,
debugger, together with the model to train and deploy an endpoint.
